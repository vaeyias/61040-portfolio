### Three Selected Domains

**Group Trip Coordination**
This past summer, I traveled frequently with large groups and was usually the primary planner and organizer. While the trips were extremely fun, I faced many challenges in coordinating group activities, from tracking everyone's preferences to ensuring everyone stayed up to date with the latest updates. I realized how much time and effort is required to keep everything running smoothly. Although I love group trips, I believe that reducing the stress of managing them would make the experience more enjoyable for everyone.

**Long Distance Friendships**
During a MISTI internship, I met many amazing friends from across the world, and I've been worried about eventually losing contact. Differences in time zones and distance make staying updated on each other's lives and planning calls or activities a hassle. After going to college, I've experienced some of my high school friendships fading because of inconsistent communication. I believe that finding ways to simplify staying connected would help maintain these meaningful relationships.

**Meal Preparation**
I live in a cook-for-yourself dorm and often struggle with planning meals and grocery shopping. Managing nutrition, avoiding food waste, and staying within a weekly budget are constant challenges. As someone who is extremely indecisive, I've noticed how much time and mental effort goes into making decisions about meals every day. I feel like a tool to simplify meal planning could make cooking more efficient and less of a hassle.

## 2. Problems

### Problems in Each Domain

**Group Trips**
1. Tracking Expenses: Keeping track of personal and group expenses
2. Itinerary Planning: Organizing group trip activities
3. Group Communication: Sharing updates with everyone

**Long Distance Friendships**
1. Time Zone Coordination: Scheduling across different time zones
2. Maintaining Communication: Staying in regular contact
3. Coordinating Activities: Planning shared events or meetups

**Meal Preparation**
1. Meal Planning: Deciding what to cook
2. Managing Groceries: Shopping efficiently within budget
3. Getting Nutritional Balance: Ensuring healthy, balanced meals

### Three Selected Problems

**Tracking Expenses**
Managing expenses is a constant source of stress during trips, especially keeping track of who owes whom what and adhering to everyone's personal budgets. On many of our trips, each person maintained their own record of expenses in notes or spreadsheets, which often led to conflicting information and tension within the group. Additionally, with people covering costs for one another, it is easy to lose track of how much you personally spent. A solution to this seems feasible and would be a major help in managing group expenses.

**Time Zone Coordination**
One of the biggest challenges in maintaining long-distance relationships is scheduling activities across multiple time zones. I have frequently struggled to find suitable times to connect with friends around the world, which often results in plans falling through. A tool that simplifies scheduling and helps manage these time zone differences could make it much easier to maintain meaningful relationships.

**Managing Groceries**
Deciding what to buy, avoiding food waste, and staying within a budget has consistently been a challenge for me throughout college. These issues impact both my time and money, making meal preparation more stressful. While I currently rely on a notes app for grocery lists, it quickly becomes difficult to maintain given how often I cook. Additionally, I need to keep track of a lot of information, from ingredient costs to where to purchase them, and managing all of this in a simple notes app often becomes confusing.

### Problems Not Selected

**Itinerary Planning**
A meaningful solution would most likely be far too complex. There would need to be some sort of algorithm that accounts for multiple preferences, time constraints, and activity options. A simpler solution could probably be achieved with general tools like word documents.

**Group Communication**
While making sure everyone is kept up to date with updates and information is still a challenge, improving on existing communication tools would likely be a minor enhancement rather than a major solution, and might inconvenience users by adding another platform to manage.

**Coordinating Activities**
While coordinating activities among long distance friends is challenging, it depends heavily on personal preferences, which makes a software-based solution more limited or more complex to implement. Additionally, I think this problem is less widespread than the other problems in maintaining long distance friendships.

**Maintaining Communication**
This problem is more related to personal motivation and habits than to technological limitations. A software solution might help remind users, but ultimately the challenge relies on people's willingness to stay in touch, making it less suitable as a project focus.

**Meal Planning**
While deciding what to cook is a source of decision fatigue, an effective solution would require extensive personalization based on individual tastes, dietary restrictions, and cooking skills. This amount of user input would make the tool too complex, reducing its feasibility for this project.

**Nutritional Balance**
While important, many existing apps already track nutrition in various ways. Since I don't monitor my nutritional balance very rigorously and simple methods like note-taking would be sufficient for me, I have less personal motivation to pursue this as a project.

## 3. Stakeholders

**Tracking Expenses**
- **Trip Organizer**: Responsible for keeping group finances clear
- **Travelers**: People sharing expenses and reimbursing each other
- **Payment Platforms**: Payment apps like Venmo and CashApp

**Impacts**: Travelers experience stress and confusion over managing many expenses. Trip organizers must handle additional coordination and resolve potential disputes. Payment platforms are impacted by increased transaction volume, potential disputes or chargebacks, and higher user support requests.

**Time Zone Coordination**
- **User**: Person trying to maintain long-distance friendships
- **Friend**: Individual in a different time zone
- **Communication Platforms**: Zoom, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.

**Impacts**: Users may struggle to find suitable times to connect with long distance friends, leading to their friendships fading. Friends may feel neglected or frustrated with not being able to coordinate calls. Communication platforms are affected by engagement patterns.

**Managing Groceries**
- **Primary Shopper**: Person grocery shopping
- **Roommates/Family**: People sharing groceries or contributing to costs
- **Grocery Stores/Delivery Services**: Provide ingredients and delivery logistics

**Impacts**: The primary shopper experiences stress, wasted time, and overspending. Roommates/family may face conflicts or dissatisfaction with groceries purchased, like the cost or amount. Grocery stores and delivery services may experience irregular demand, cancellations, or returns.

## 5. Features

### Tracking Expenses

1. **Group and Personal Expense Tracker**
Enables both group and individual expense tracking within trips. Users can log shared or individual expenses, specify who paid and who benefited, and automatically calculate who owes whom. Each user can also organize their personal expenses by trip, category, or payer type (self vs. others). The tracker supports personal budgets with notifications when nearing limits, giving users a clear picture of what they personally spent, what others covered for them, and what they covered for others.

2. **Shared Wallet Overview**
Provides a real-time snapshot of the group’s available funds and payment methods. Displays each member’s supported payment options (credit cards, mobile wallets like Alipay, Paylah, WeChat Pay, etc.), along with any constraints like “no foreign transaction fees”. Also tracks how much cash each member currently holds, broken down by currency, to help the group make quick, informed decisions about who should pay.

3. **Payment Preferences & Settlement Profiles**
Allows users to set up their preferred repayment methods, including choice of currency, cash, or specific apps. Links these preferences to their profile so other group members know the smoothest way to settle debts with them. This ensures that when it’s time to pay each other back, there is no confusion about how to pay someone back.
### Time Zone Coordination

1. **Group World Clock**
Displays the time zone for all members of a group with a clear indicator of whether it's a reasonable hour to contact each person and highlights windows of overlapping waking hours.

2. **Scheduling Polls**
Allows users to send polls to schedule calls/events. The polls are shown in each user's own time zone, and highlights the times when the most people are free.

3. **Contextual Message Timestamps**
Augments every message sent within the app to show two timestamps: the sender's local time and the receiver's local time. This provides clearer context for when messages are sent and received across time zones.

### Managing Groceries

1. **Collaborative Shopping List**
A shared list organized by categories where users can manually add items. Shows price ranges for items across different nearby stores or stores the user has linked, helping users choose where to shop.

2. **Pantry Tracker**
A shared list organized by categories where users can track available ingredients. This can be integrated with the shopping list: items that the user checks off on the shopping list will be added to the pantry.

3. **Recipe Book**
A collection of the user's recipes or saved recipes from other users, listing required ingredients and instructions or links to original recipes. The recipes can be added to the user's meal plan calendar and the ingredients list can be added to their grocery list.
